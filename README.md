# movies
This repository is made up of code that when executed will provide a website of my favorite movies. It is in a format that allows the user to play the trailers and read a short storyline of the individual movies I like.

To execute run the fresh_tomatoes.html file on your browser.

If you are running it from your command line, you can execute entertainment_center.py with command python ./<file_name>. Be sure to have the python interpreter installed.

This repository is used in Udacity's Full Stack Developers course
